# Report: Software Technology Experiment 1 

## Software Development Environment
This experiment requires the four following software installed to make up the development environment.
* Java Development Environment (JDK)
* An Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
   * In this case, IntelliJ was chosen.
* Maven software management tool
* Git
### 1. Pre-installed software
The following software was already installed:
* JDK
* IntelliJ
* Git

However, updates were available for all the above software. Therefore, the following updates were done.
*JDK 15 was updated to JDK 16
*IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2.4 was updated to IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2.1
*Git 2.28.0 was updated to Git 2.33.0

### 2. Installation of missing software
    
While installing Maven there was a slight issue whith the extraction of the zip containing the downloaded software. 
The problem was that 7zip that was used to unzip did not have permission to place the file in the folder program files.

This was solved by using Windows 10's native file extraction.

### 3.  Validating the environment
To validate that the software development environment was up and working a version check for java, 
maven and git was done by the following commands in command prompt:
* java -version
* mvn -version
* git --version

All witch gave the expected response with the correct versions.

To validate IntelliJ it was simply opened after updating to the newest version to confirm it was functional.


## Heroku
### 1. Issues with the Heroku platform
There was a slight issue with the heroku account validation when the tutorial was handling addons. 
However, this was easily solved by requesting a new validation link and following the instructions.
